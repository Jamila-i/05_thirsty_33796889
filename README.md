# SipJam – Thirsty Student Shop (Lab 5)

This project was created for my **Dynamic Web Applications** module.  
It’s a Node.js and Express web application that uses **EJS templates** to dynamically display data for a fictional drinks shop called **SipJam**.

The main purpose of this lab was to explore **templating**, **routing**, and **form handling** in Express — including GET and POST requests, and validation.

## 💻 Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JS on the server.
- **Express.js** – lightweight web framework for handling routes, HTTP requests, and middleware.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)** – templating engine used to generate dynamic HTML pages by embedding JS directly into HTML files.
- **Body Parser (built into Express)** – middleware that reads form data from POST requests.

### Frontend

- **HTML5** – structure of all pages and EJS templates.
- **CSS** – custom styles defined in `public/styles.css` for layout, colour, and responsiveness.

## Features

### Home Page (`/`)

- Displays the shop name and a list of drink categories.
- Uses EJS loops to generate the list dynamically from `shopData`.

### About Page (`/about`)

- Shows a short description of SipJam and a dynamically generated list of shop branches (London, Manchester, Birmingham).

### Search Page (`/search`)

- Demonstrates a GET form that sends search data through query parameters.
- Returns a confirmation of what the user searched for.

### Register Page (`/register`)

- Contains a POST form for collecting user information (first name, last name, and email).
- Includes email validation and server-side checks.

### Customer Survey (`/survey`)

- A longer POST form that collects personal info and survey questions (age, drink preference, student status).
- Demonstrates form validation and use of radio buttons and checkboxes.

### Survey Results (`/survey_submitted`)

- Displays the submitted survey results inside a **styled card** using data passed through POST.
