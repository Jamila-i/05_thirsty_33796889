# Thirsty Student Shop (Lab 5a-b)

This project was created for my **Dynamic Web Applications** module.  
It’s a small Node.js and Express web app that uses **EJS** templates to show information about a fictional drinks shop called _The Thirsty Student_.

The goal of this lab was to learn how to render HTML dynamically using EJS and to separate the presentation (HTML) from the application logic (JavaScript).

## What the project does

The app has three pages:

- **Home page** – shows the shop name and a list of products (generated dynamically).
- **About page** – a short description of the shop.
- **Search page** – a placeholder for a future search feature.

2. Install the required packages: npm install

4. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000
